# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game app implemented in Kotlin using Android Studio. The game consists of a set of cards with images that need to be matched by the user. 

## Implementation

The app uses a RecyclerView to display the cards, and each card is represented by a `MemoryCard` object. The `MemoryCardAdapter` is responsible for populating the RecyclerView with the cards and handling user clicks. The `MainActivity` initializes the RecyclerView with a grid layout and sets up the cards.

### MemoryCard

This class represents a card in the game. Each card has a unique identifier, an image resource, and flags indicating whether it is currently face up or matched. 

### MemoryCardAdapter

This class extends RecyclerView.Adapter and is responsible for populating the RecyclerView with MemoryCardViewHolder instances. The clickListener argument is a lambda that is called when a card is clicked. 

### MemoryCardViewHolder

This class represents a ViewHolder for the MemoryCardAdapter. It binds a MemoryCard object to a view and handles user clicks. 

### MainActivity

This class sets up the RecyclerView with a grid layout and initializes the cards. It also handles user clicks and updates the UI accordingly.

## Getting Started
